Looking at Exhibit 1 on page 4, I can see the base rates in dollar amounts, and I also found the Hurricane factors in various exhibits.\n\nBased on the information from the documents:\n\n**The Hurricane base rate for HO3 policies is $293.**\n\nThis information is found in:\n* **Exhibit 1, Page 4** - which shows the base rates in dollar amounts for different coverage types, with Hurricane listed as $293\n\nAdditionally, I can see from the various factor tables (Exhibits 10-19) that:\n* The Hurricane factor for HO3 policies across protection classes is typically 1.000 (found in Exhibit 10, Page 139)\n* However, there are variations based on specific characteristics like home age, year built, roof cover, etc. that can modify this base rate\n\nFor example:\n* Year built factors (Exhibit 12) show Hurricane factors ranging from 0.720 for newer homes (2024+) to 1.000 for older homes\n* Home age factors (Exhibit 11) show Hurricane factors that vary by the age of the home, typically ranging from around 0.784 to 0.998\n\nSo the Hurricane base rate for HO3 policies is **$293**, which then gets modified by various factors depending on the specific characteristics of the property and policy.",
